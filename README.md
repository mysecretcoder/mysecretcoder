- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mysecretcoder
Hi there,
â˜…â˜…â˜… Web Design & Development Expert â˜…â˜…â˜… 6+ Years of Experience â˜…â˜…â˜…


I'm a web developer who specialises in high-quality Wordpress development.

I've spent the last 6 years working with Wordpress, HTML5, CSS3, Responsive Mobile Web Design, Website Performance Optimization, JavaScript, PHP, WooCommerce, and jQuery.



I have created and maintained over 50 Wordpress websites from the ground up.



I am focused on creating user-friendly websites. My top priority is employer satisfaction.



Please take the time to review my education, portfolio, tests, and recommendations.



Thank you for giving me the opportunity to prove myself.
